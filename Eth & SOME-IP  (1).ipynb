Called: (BroadR-Reach)!\n- **Sync** : it is asynchronous serial communication protocol as there is no a clock line for signals.\n- **Direction of data** : Ethernet is known by nature as half-duplex since hubs; yet, switches have come to make communication either full or half-duplex.\n\n## Ethernet in terms of OSI Layer\n\n- For better understand,\n- Physical layer has the hardware specs for the ethernet and data bits to transfer.\n- Data Link refers the MAC-address and the frame to be sent.\n- Network refers to the packet that is about IP Networking + routing in addition to the payload + the frame.\n- Transport Layer is about Segments transfer by TCP/UDP\n- Data layer contains the whole data of the ethernet to be sent (Especially for application Layer).\n\n## What is the ARP Table? and its request?\n\n* ARP stands for Address solution protocol, which is used to store the IPs to the coresponding MAC-address for better connection and fast communication.\n* ARP request is a broadcast in order to find the IP through the corsponding MAC-address in case they aren't stored in the table.\n\n## VLAN\n\n- it stands for virtual LAN that is used to make one or more than one device in such a virtual network as they were connected together with a local ethernet wire. \n\n## IP Specs\n\n- IPv4 is IP contains of 4 bytes i.e. the most common known `IP 192.168.1.1`\n- the subnet mask contains of also 4 bytes i.e. `255.255.255.0`\n\n- In order To know that the device is in the same network, you ought to add (&) them together and thus you would find the number of the network. In addition, the number that is added (&) by 0 is the node Number in the network. \n\n- IPv6 is IP contains of 6 bytes. It has long address space up to 2 power of 48 is a huge room for IPs.\n\n- IPv6 doesn't rely on network addressing translation `(NAT)`, which gives more conservation for IPv4 to use even an repetitive IP for more IPs usage. Hence, IPv6 doesn't reply on it, which gives a unique IP address globally for each device and simplifying the addressing and routing process.\n\n- IPv6 has longer frame format, but the whole frame is about data without any security regardless IPv4. That is why reaching to IPv6 is faster than IPv4 due to the security checksums and so on.\n\n## Ethernet in terms of AUTOSAR!\n\n- Well, after those headlines of Ethernet, AUTOSAR provides ethernet in `COM stack within 7 layers`, from the physical to the UDP. We have here 5 features supported by AUTOSAR for Ethernet-based COM. \n\n- **Ethernet Communication Stack** : AutoSAR provides a standardized communication stack for ethernet. It consists of 7 layers, including Ethernet Driver Layer, Ethernet Virtual Link , Ethernet Network Management , Ethernet for higher protocol interface (IP) , Ethernet (TCP) and Ethernet UDP.\n\n- **Ethernet Services** : Autosar provides Ethernet-based Communication with APIs ( Application Programming Interfaces) to support sending and receiving Ethernet frames , handling management functions, managing virutal links and supporting IP communication services.\n\n- **Ethernet Configurations** : AUTOSAR provides high reliability of configuration for Ethernet-based communication to ensure high performance of configuring such as IPs , subnet masks , routing tables , and other specific parameters.\n\n- **Ethernet Time Sync** : Ethernet-based communication seeks precise timing and synchronization for communications. Especially, they are crucial for critical time applications. AUTOSAR has a standard `(802.1AS)` that supports time sync to ensure that all communication are on time and synchronized, which is the most preferable for Ethernet for stable communication between all ECUs.\n\n- **Ethernet Diagnostics** : AUTOSAR provides Diagnostics Services for Ethernet-based COM for better handling to the diagnostics trouble codes (DTCs) and monitoring network health and status as well as Diagnotics interfaces.\n\n## How Ethernet Time & Sync works\n\n- The mechanism of Time Sync is done via sending `PTP protocol (Precision Time Protocol)` over different messages handlded among master and slaves.\n\n- Master always sends time Sync to the slave and then after period of time sends again something similar like Time-Follow-Up to have the time difference between them. \n\n- After then the slave sends a delay-request, in a result, the master sends delay-response and calc the time from slave to master for different propagation time. It is similar to a request and response sessions for better understanding and imaginations.\n\n---",

      "source": "## SomeIP\n- To begin with, SOME-IP refers to Service-oriented MiddlewarE Over IP.\n- To perceive the concept of the process communication, you need to know what IPC is.\n\n## Types of IPC methods\n- First of all, (IPC) inter-process communication refers on how different processes can communicate on certain things such as to exchange data, coordinate activities, and communicate with each other within a computer system.\n\nHere we can interpret the 7 IPC Methods for further clarification:\n\n1. **Pipes**: is the simplest form of IPC communcation that allow two proccess to communicate together. Indeed, it is a unidirectional communication method, in other words, where output of one proccess is connected to the input of the other proccess. It is used within related processes, especially, between parent process and child process.\n\n2. **Named Pipes(FIFOs)** : It is similar to Pipes, but with mechanism FIFO ( first input, first output). Also, it refers toward unrelated proccesses, regardless the composition relationship from parent and child. It is done by creating files in the file system in order to make other proccesses access file for better communication.\n\n3. **Message Queue** : Message queue is capable of initiating the communication between proccesses in a way of one proccess to send messages to a queue and the other proccess receive the messages from the queue, and in other words, the queue is the third-party tool among proccesses. Note that, the message is known by its type and thus the proccess select the message as per of its kind.\n\n4. **Shared Memory**: It is a way to let a proccess access a segment of memory another proccess. This enables proccesses to read and write in others' memories and this is a great priviledge to initiate a communication. One way to defeat is the data race, which should be protected by semaphores or mutex and thus no issues are longer available.\n\n5. **Socket** : Is a network communication, which let proccess to talk to another proccess through a network. It is used for both inter proccess communication in the machine (like UNIX) or in the network ( `like TCP/IP or UDC/IP` ).\n\n6. **Remote Procedure Call (RPC) **: it is a way to make a remote communication between two proccesses. RPC abstracts the details of communication and data marshaling, making it easier to develop distributed systems.\n\n7. **Signals** : Signals are a simple form of notification messages. It is used to notify a proccess with events or to request attention. Proccesses can send and receive signals, it allows them to communicate either in simple messages or notify events or  handle various events such as process termination, user-defined events, or error conditions.",

      "source": "## SOME-IP in Adaptive AUTOSAR\n\n- It is called **vSomeIP Stack** in Adaptive AUTOSAR.\n\n- A brief about Adaptive Autosar, it is an evaluation of the classical Autosar with the same component, but some others are named differently. Also, it is enhanced away better than the classical one in terms of scalability, High-performance, and flexible automotive architectures.\n\n- SOMEIP provides a standardized framework for communication between SW components in Adaptive Autosar. As we been into the SOMEip above, it is related to IP-ing and networking both locally and remotely between components running in different ECUs in the vechile to services among them.\n\n## Hereas some benefits SOMEIP participates in Adaptive AUTOSAR\n\n1. **Standardized** : it enables the communication between SW components in Adaptive AUTOSAR. It enhances the communication between SW components, ECUs and other various systems from different vendors. It increases the flexibility of data exchanging from all around.\n\n2. **Network Flexibility**: some services use the network to exchange data, so SOMEIP enables to send data over IP networks. It supports Ethernet, CAN and different communication protocol. It is more scalable and adaptable communication solutions.\n\n3. **Scalability** : it supports scalable communication ARCH. It enables to integrate large number of SW components and ECUs within an adaptive autosar. It allows for efficient and complex communication in a network or distrbuted systems. \n\n4. **Service-Oriented Arch** : SOMEIP follows the service techinque (SOA), where SW components can use services that are invoked/called by another SW components.\n\n5. **High Performance** : SOMEIP is known by his high performance in communication between components.\n\n6. **Security** : SOMEIP follows good approach of security to secure the communication between components. It plays a good role in making security from some security protocol from Transport Layer Security (TLS) and encrypted communication within Adaptive AUTOSAR.\n---",

      "source": "## POSIX\n\nPOSIX stands for (Portable Operating System Interface) that is invoked within Adaptive AUTOSAR. It is **a family of standards** that are used for compatibility between different OS. It promotes to be running adaptively accross UNIX-Like operating systems.\n\n## Here are the families of POSIX\n\n- **POSIX.1** : this is a standard `specifies the core functionality of OS APIs`, including file I/O proccess management and signals. These APIs are used to create a interaction between Application and Operating System.\n\n- **POSIX.1B** : this standard is `known for threads or pThreads`. It includes several APIs that support creating, managing, synchronization, and handling threads in the Applications.\n\n- **POSIX.1C** : this standard is known `for time-real extensions`. It provides APIs that are highly used in such real-critical time Applications. It is especially used to build time-critical Apps. i.e. Airbag system that needs critical time apps for high responsiveness.\n\n- **POSIX.1D** : this standard is known for `file and directory services`.\n    \n## POSIX Communication Method\n\nPOSIX uses IPC methods in order to communication with proccesses and `transmission of notifications among them`.\n\n- It uses **Named_Pipes [ FIFOs ]** that is used to transmit messages from two unrelated proccesses through a unidirectional method upon FIFO concept.\n\n- **Message Queues** are also highly used due to it is ability to transmit messages between unrelated proccessess through queue of messages. A mechanism for message-based notification.\n\n- **Socket** is well-known by his high usage as it is a service-oriented over the network. It allows proccesses to communicate over the network, which gives a wide range of COM among different proccesses from different ECUs.\n\n- **Signal** is an interrupt SW mechanism used for notifying proccess of events or to request attention from proccesses. It is basic forms of communication and notification between processes.\n\n## Specifications of POSIX\n\nHere we have POSIX data types and system calls.\n\n- POSIX uses these **specific various data types** to represent the portability concept over different OSs.\n\n1. **size_t** : Used to represent sizes of objects in bytes.\n2. **pid_t** : Used to represent process IDs.\n3. **time_t** : Used to represent time values.\n4. **off_t** : Used to represent file offsets.\n5. **mode_t** : Used to represent file permissions and modes.\n6. **uid_t and gid_t** : Used to represent user and group IDs, respectively.\n7. **pthread_t** : Used to represent thread IDs.\n\n- POSIX uses **system calls** , which are APIs that are used as a middleware, that provide APIs for applications to interact with the OS. In a short brief, they cover some functionality such as proccess management, file I\\O , networking, and some more. Here are the system calls commonly used:-\n\n1. **fork()** : Creates a new process by duplicating the existing process.\n2. **exec()** : Replaces the current process with a new process.\n3. **open(), read(), write(), close()** : Perform file I/O operations.\n4. **pipe(), mkfifo()** : Create pipes and FIFOs for inter-process communication.\n5. **socket(), bind(), listen(), accept()** : Establish network connections using sockets.\n6. **pthread_create(), pthread_join()** : Create and manage threads using Pthreads.\n---",
